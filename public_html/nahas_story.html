							  <h4><a href="#" title=""><b>A Challenging Choice</b></a></h4>
							  <p>I recently graduated from a reputed college and hail from a happy family where I received a good upbringing. I have been grappling with a question which I didn’t feel comfortable sharing with my parents. Despite going to a school that was co-educational, I did not get involved with boys romantically though I was judged for this by my school mates. However, these days I have been having thoughts of developing a healthy relationship with a man who shares my feelings and who respects me.</p>

							  <p>With this intention, I began observing the men in my college. I shared my plan with my close friend and with her help we zeroed in on a guy who we considered a good candidate. She gathered details about him without his knowledge and we found out that he is from a reputed family and is about to begin a job at a firm. Not just that, he was also good-looking. I had also received a few job offers and was planning to begin working soon.</p>

							  <p>However, before going ahead and approaching him, I wanted to get an objective opinion about my plan– whether it is the right step?  What are possible consequences?  The SAHAI counsellor I spoke to asked me to consider all aspects of a relationship before initiating it. He said that since both of us are entering the professional arena for the first time, I should keep in mind that this will bring with it a whole new set of relationships into my life- from bosses and co-workers to hierarchies of all sorts. Navigating these relationships will involve learning new skills and a considerable amount of energy. Besides, he asked me to take into account factors that might affect my prospective relationship- such as our pay packages, where we are posted, work timings, personal ambition and so on. </p>

							  <p>And since I had decided that if the relationship wasn’t to my liking, I would leave him, the counsellor said that once I have known a person intimately, did I think I would emerge unscathed if the relationship does not work out. Sharing my mind and life in depth with another person would obviously bring with it considerable pain if I choose to leave the relationship.</p>

							  <p>He asked me to consider establishing myself in my career especially since I also had plan to pursue a Master’s degree and then begin choosing a person who is worthy of me. After this, I took some time to think about all the factors which the counsellor asked me to consider while making a decision and the measured advice I got from SAHAI really helped me make a wise choice.</p>

								<p>"I work as a school teacher in Goa and have always found the pressure at the workplace too heavy for me to bear. Internal politics at the school is unpleasant and I have always run away from these situations when I am caught up in them. Unfortunately, every job has these work pressures and politics and my coping strategy has always been to resign after some months and find another job. I have been lucky so far in that I have been successful in finding new jobs that are good and pay well. However, I am really worried because I know that I cannot continue doing this each time. I found the SAHAI Helpline number during a random Google search and called them up. Taking to the counsellor there helped me gain a fresh perspective on my work-related anxieties. I have since worked on my improving communication and assertiveness skills and this has helped me in a big way. Thank you very much."</p>

								<p>"Hailing from a small village in Andhra Pradesh, I am the first person from there to become an engineer and live and work in a corporate job in a big city. Bangalore has been home for four years now and yet I am incredibly unhappy here. I don't fit in with the mall and pub philosophy that my colleagues subscribe to. So, I am left out of their circle. Loneliness is my constant companion since I have no other friends. I am not fluent in conversing in English and also get mocked by my colleagues for this. I have to pay the EMIs for the loan I took to buy my flat and so I cannot leave my job either. My parents are very proud of me and where I have got to in life, so I couldn't share my challenges with them? I was suicidal when I began calling up the SAHAI helpline. I had counsellors who spoke to me for 2 hours during some sessions. If I had not received the kind of encouragement and advice that I did from them, I do not know if I would even be alive today. Through these counselling sessions I realised that I am not alone and that made a big difference. I understood what my strengths are and began going for English-speaking classes. I am soon beginning meditations and yoga classes too. My life is so far more enjoyable than before and I feel more positive."</p>

								<p>"My boyfriend and I had been together for three years now when he suddenly began avoiding my calls and stopped meeting me as much as he used to. The relationship seemed to be fading and it was breaking my heart. I hadn’t been a demanding girlfriend or asked him for an assurance of marriage. In fact, my parents disapproved of our relationship and despite that I had stayed with him. As a 27 year old, I felt I gave him the best years of my life. I was feeling helpless when I spoke to the counsellor at SAHAI. It was the first time since this phase in my relationship began that I felt grounded and calm. Thank you for listening to me without judgements and for directing my attention to all that is working well in my life. I now feel I have so much to look forward to in life and my decision to move on without resentment has been possible because of my conversations with the counsellor. I know now more than ever that I am in charge of my own life and my own happiness."</p>

								<p>"Overwhelmed by the circumstances in my life, I began calling SAHAI and speaking to the counsellors at the other end of the line. Suffering from depression for the past seven years, my wife’s mental and emotional state is such that she is not able to give our three children the love and attention that they deserve. Counselling is an option that she refuses to consider since she believes that only people who are “mad” go to a counsellor and she fears societal judgement if she seeks help. I am trying my best to play the role of both mother and father to my children but I am increasingly stretched thin. Though I know that the counsellors cannot fix my situation, speaking about it to them has helped me immensely. It has given me the strength to do everything in my power to give my children a happy life. Thank you for the valuable support."</p>
