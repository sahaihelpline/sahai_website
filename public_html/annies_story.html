							  <h4><a href="#" title=""><b>Catching Heights</b></a></h4>
							  <p>We all have a certain perspective of other people, and for some reason we always believe that other’s have it easier than us, and of course some people might but that is just how life is. For me as a teenager a lot of people would think I had it easy because well, I was just doing my schooling how hard could life be? Little did people know how easily bullying can mentally dismantle a person.</p>

							  <p>When I was around 11 years old was when I first started to cut myself, to be completely honest I did not even know what I was doing – it just felt like my pain was diminishing, I felt stronger because I didn’t mind being cut. And it made me think away from all the bullying I was undergoing at school. I came from a conservative and highly dysfunctional family so I couldn’t communicate this pain with anyone, not the school authorities nor my parents or sisters. So I decided to suffer in silence rather than bringing up childish nonsense between fights at home. Years passed by and I travelled from Laos to Mexico to India. In Mexico I went through more bullying, criticizing my skin tone, my heights, my hair and what not. I couldn’t bare it, but I made friends who helped me get through the tough times. That is until I went for a summer vacation to India where I was molested (I was 12 by the way) it left a scar, it was a secret I wouldn’t tell anyone- I felt dirty- but I had one thing in brain “I won’t be living here anyway” and my worries withered away, the pain however, did not, I was too scared to let anyone even touch me. That was till I changed schools and met with what was paradise when I went back to Mexico. For the first time in my life cutting did not attract me, I was happy, people around me were amazing, they gave me attention and helped me get over the hardest times in my life. It felt right, I could hug people again and I stopped feeling dirty I was in grade 9 and other than family drama all was going well until I overheard a little conversation at home “So we are shifting?” “Let’s let her complete her grade 10?” “No, this is necessary.” I knew what this meant- I was going back to India and doom fell upon me, I started taking pills, and cutting and drinking bleach and anything I could find. If I had to go- I would rather die. No one in my family knew I was self harming, but everyone knew I didn’t want to go so I was told it would be a 6 months thing.</p>

							  <p>6 months became a year, and then another. Throughout my time in India I only felt worthless and betrayed. I was called a slut, a whore and a dumb bitch. I wasn’t given importance at school and my parents were called for the stupidest little things. All my life I had been an A* student with 0 complaints and my life was officially falling apart. I believed that my dream to study at Yale would vanquish if I continued in this place, I was lost of all hope. I wanted to die. I stood in front of cars- and would get saved. Cut. I punched myself. I took pills. Went drunk to school. I did everything and anything that would make the pain and thoughts go away. I started talking to my school counselor and teachers who were the only people to ever support me. I am glad I took help they told me I should talk to my parents and focus on school. They gave me the hope I needed. Told me to keep writing my thoughts (I have been writing since grade 6) I decided I wouldn’t back down so quickly. I begged my parents to take me out and to my surprise it worked. Mid my grade 12 I went to Tanzania. It was a gamble since I would have to do grade 11 again due to system changes, but I did it. It was the best decision I ever made.</p>

							  <p>I stopped cutting in Tanzania, got over all my problems. It took me 7 years to stop self-harm completely but I got there. I am still there. I don’t cut anymore. Tanzania was my run away, people told me I was running away, toxic friends said it would destroy me. I knew better, Tanzania changed me. Gave me friends and the life I wanted. Everything was great until my father passed away… I hadn’t started my Grade 12 and I knew what it meant- I would have to go back to India.</p>

							  <p>Life was shattering down. But this time I wouldn’t let it destroy me. I knew I needed to be stronger. I took action, called my school and figured something out. Called my siblings in India and told them we would be coming back. It was painful, I couldn’t cry. I took responsibility. But I was stronger than ever. My life has taught me that anything can happen at any time, you always need a support system, sometimes it was friends, mentors, and now my family.</p>

							  <p>Don’t tell yourself you will be okay. Consult someone. Talk it out! Live your life to the fullest and achieve your dreams. Life is a rollercoaster for all of us, but we can get through it. I did.</p>

							  <p>My life is not perfect right now, I still have problems and things I haven’t figured out. I do get angry and want to go down the same road. But I calm myself, talk to someone and write the pain down. I have better things to do now- I have Catching Heights to look after, a book to write, and people to influence.</p>

							  <p>Take charge of life and you will go far. I am trying to and hope I do.</p>

								<p>"I work as a school teacher in Goa and have always found the pressure at the workplace too heavy for me to bear. Internal politics at the school is unpleasant and I have always run away from these situations when I am caught up in them. Unfortunately, every job has these work pressures and politics and my coping strategy has always been to resign after some months and find another job. I have been lucky so far in that I have been successful in finding new jobs that are good and pay well. However, I am really worried because I know that I cannot continue doing this each time. I found the SAHAI Helpline number during a random Google search and called them up. Taking to the counsellor there helped me gain a fresh perspective on my work-related anxieties. I have since worked on my improving communication and assertiveness skills and this has helped me in a big way. Thank you very much."</p>

								<p>"Hailing from a small village in Andhra Pradesh, I am the first person from there to become an engineer and live and work in a corporate job in a big city. Bangalore has been home for four years now and yet I am incredibly unhappy here. I don't fit in with the mall and pub philosophy that my colleagues subscribe to. So, I am left out of their circle. Loneliness is my constant companion since I have no other friends. I am not fluent in conversing in English and also get mocked by my colleagues for this. I have to pay the EMIs for the loan I took to buy my flat and so I cannot leave my job either. My parents are very proud of me and where I have got to in life, so I couldn't share my challenges with them? I was suicidal when I began calling up the SAHAI helpline. I had counsellors who spoke to me for 2 hours during some sessions. If I had not received the kind of encouragement and advice that I did from them, I do not know if I would even be alive today. Through these counselling sessions I realised that I am not alone and that made a big difference. I understood what my strengths are and began going for English-speaking classes. I am soon beginning meditations and yoga classes too. My life is so far more enjoyable than before and I feel more positive."</p>

								<p>"My boyfriend and I had been together for three years now when he suddenly began avoiding my calls and stopped meeting me as much as he used to. The relationship seemed to be fading and it was breaking my heart. I hadn’t been a demanding girlfriend or asked him for an assurance of marriage. In fact, my parents disapproved of our relationship and despite that I had stayed with him. As a 27 year old, I felt I gave him the best years of my life. I was feeling helpless when I spoke to the counsellor at SAHAI. It was the first time since this phase in my relationship began that I felt grounded and calm. Thank you for listening to me without judgements and for directing my attention to all that is working well in my life. I now feel I have so much to look forward to in life and my decision to move on without resentment has been possible because of my conversations with the counsellor. I know now more than ever that I am in charge of my own life and my own happiness."</p>

								<p>"Overwhelmed by the circumstances in my life, I began calling SAHAI and speaking to the counsellors at the other end of the line. Suffering from depression for the past seven years, my wife’s mental and emotional state is such that she is not able to give our three children the love and attention that they deserve. Counselling is an option that she refuses to consider since she believes that only people who are “mad” go to a counsellor and she fears societal judgement if she seeks help. I am trying my best to play the role of both mother and father to my children but I am increasingly stretched thin. Though I know that the counsellors cannot fix my situation, speaking about it to them has helped me immensely. It has given me the strength to do everything in my power to give my children a happy life. Thank you for the valuable support."</p>
