				  <h2><strong>Our</strong> Callers</h2>
				</div>
				<p>SAHAI gets calls from people from all walks of life and age groups, persons with relationship problems, career-related problems, professionals with employment-related issues, students with peer pressure.</p>
				<p>Depression, drug, alcohol or substance abuse exacts their toll. Others are weighed down by dowry-related issues, retirement problems, and domestic issues. The trauma of incest or guilt arising from sex related issues also prompts some callers to reach out for help. Callers may face interpersonal issues which result in low self-esteem or have problems at work. Unfortunately, most of these issues lead people to the edge of despair.</p>
				<p>Callers to SAHAI are in a crisis looking forward for help and we offer the emotional support that is required.

				  <h2><strong>Our</strong> Volunteers</h2>
				</div>
				<p>For the past 14 years SAHAI has been functioning with trained volunteers, who have life experiences and compassion to help out. The volunteers come from all walks of life and are of varied age group. They are retired persons, professionals, educationists, home makers and students who have completed a counseling course from a reputed institution or have undergone a 40 hours training, conducted in-house where faculty of experts in the field of mental health come to train.</p>
				<p>Volunteers are trained to listen with empathy, help each caller ventilate, to respond without judging, and to guide the caller to address their problem. Volunteers learn how to listen pro-actively, and to recognize and assess signs of stress and depression.</p>

						<h3 style="margin: 20px 0 0 0;">National crime bureau statistics collected for 2014</h3>
						<p style="font-size: 11px;line-height: 20px;">The four Metropolitan Cities — Chennai (2,214), Bangalore (1,906), Delhi (1,847) and Mumbai (1,196) have reported higher number of suicides. These four cities together have reported almost 36.6% of the total suicides reported from 53 mega cities. The means adopted for committing suicide varied from the easily available means such as consumption of poison, jumping into the well etc. to more painful means such as self inflicted injuries, hanging, shooting, etc. Like previous year, ‘Hanging’ (41.8%), Consuming ‘Poison’ (26.0%), ‘Self-Immolation’ (6.9%) and ‘Drowning’ (5.6%) were the prominent means of committing.</p>
					</div>
					
					<div class="ongoing-project-detail">
						<h3 style="margin: 20px 0 0 0;">Suicide Victims by Sex and Age Group</h3>
						<p style="font-size: 11px;line-height: 20px;">Age group wise distribution of suicides by causes during 2014: The overall male: female ratio of suicide victims for the year 2014 was 67.7:32.3, showing a marginal increase of male and marginal decrease of female ratio as compared to year 2013 (67.2:32.8). The proportion of Boys: Girls suicide victims (below 14 years of age) were 52.3:47.7 in 2014 as compared to 53.5:46.5 in 2013. The proportion of female victims were more in ‘Marriage Related Issues’ like ‘Non-Settlement of Marriage’, ‘Dowry Related Issues’, ‘Extra-Marital Issues’, ‘Divorce’. Apart from this, ‘Failure in Examination’, ‘Impotency/Infertility’ and ‘Physical Abuse (Rape)’ were also major causes of suicides among females than among males. Youth (18 and above- below 30 years) and middle aged people (30 and above- below 45 years) were the prime groups taking recourse to the path of suicides. These age groups accounted for 34.1% and 32.2% suicides respectively. 'Other Family Problems' (245), ‘Illness’ (181) ‘Failure in Examination’ (163) were the main causes of suicides among children (below 14 years of age).</p>
						<p style="font-size: 11px;line-height: 20px;">Bangalore is more diverse and less homogenous than many cities, with less religious, familial and political integration. Social research shows that suicide varies inversely with the degree of domestic, social and religious integration.</p>

			  <h2><strong>Some</strong>  of the cases we handled</h2>
			</div>
			<p><span class="cap">Case 1:</span> Sunita (name changed) called the SAHAI Helpline for help when she was only 15 years old. She had tried to slit her wrists so many times, in a cry for help. She had been neglected by her parents and her life lacked meaning and direction.</p>
			<p>
			She came to SAHAI and spoke to the counsellor who was on duty. After that, every week, she called the SAHAI Helpline regularly – it was her way of getting the help she so desperately needed at the time.</p>
			<p>
			Today 9 years on, she has completed her Graduation with Distinction and is working for an IT company in Bangalore. She has moved on with her life. Though her problems at home haven’t changed, her attitude towards the problems and her approach and outlook on Life have changed a lot and she is a much happier person now.</p>
			<p>
			Acknowledging that you have a problem and getting the help you need, when you’re feeling down and out, is the best way to help yourself. Never give up on yourself.
			</p>
			<br><br>
			<p><span class="cap">Case 2:</span> Aruna (name changed) was having problems in her marriage. She was married to a man from another caste and community and their marriage was on the rocks. While he was toying with the idea of going in for a divorce, she was keen to save her marriage.</p>
			<p>
			Aruna approached the SAHAI Helpline and shared her problems with the counsellor who was on duty at the helpline. Over the next year, they worked together to bring about a change in Aruna’s approach and in her outlook and attitude towards her husband and her marriage.</p>
			<p>
			After one year, she finally got the breakthrough she so desperately wanted and they were able to put the problems behind them.</p>
			<p>
			Today Aruna and her husband are happy together and their son is the biggest beneficiary of their happy relationship. There is peace at home and there are three happy people.

								<p>"I work as a school teacher in Goa and have always found the pressure at the workplace too heavy for me to bear. Internal politics at the school is unpleasant and I have always run away from these situations when I am caught up in them. Unfortunately, every job has these work pressures and politics and my coping strategy has always been to resign after some months and find another job. I have been lucky so far in that I have been successful in finding new jobs that are good and pay well. However, I am really worried because I know that I cannot continue doing this each time. I found the SAHAI Helpline number during a random Google search and called them up. Taking to the counsellor there helped me gain a fresh perspective on my work-related anxieties. I have since worked on my improving communication and assertiveness skills and this has helped me in a big way. Thank you very much."</p>

								<p>"Hailing from a small village in Andhra Pradesh, I am the first person from there to become an engineer and live and work in a corporate job in a big city. Bangalore has been home for four years now and yet I am incredibly unhappy here. I don't fit in with the mall and pub philosophy that my colleagues subscribe to. So, I am left out of their circle. Loneliness is my constant companion since I have no other friends. I am not fluent in conversing in English and also get mocked by my colleagues for this. I have to pay the EMIs for the loan I took to buy my flat and so I cannot leave my job either. My parents are very proud of me and where I have got to in life, so I couldn't share my challenges with them? I was suicidal when I began calling up the SAHAI helpline. I had counsellors who spoke to me for 2 hours during some sessions. If I had not received the kind of encouragement and advice that I did from them, I do not know if I would even be alive today. Through these counselling sessions I realised that I am not alone and that made a big difference. I understood what my strengths are and began going for English-speaking classes. I am soon beginning meditations and yoga classes too. My life is so far more enjoyable than before and I feel more positive."</p>

								<p>"My boyfriend and I had been together for three years now when he suddenly began avoiding my calls and stopped meeting me as much as he used to. The relationship seemed to be fading and it was breaking my heart. I hadn’t been a demanding girlfriend or asked him for an assurance of marriage. In fact, my parents disapproved of our relationship and despite that I had stayed with him. As a 27 year old, I felt I gave him the best years of my life. I was feeling helpless when I spoke to the counsellor at SAHAI. It was the first time since this phase in my relationship began that I felt grounded and calm. Thank you for listening to me without judgements and for directing my attention to all that is working well in my life. I now feel I have so much to look forward to in life and my decision to move on without resentment has been possible because of my conversations with the counsellor. I know now more than ever that I am in charge of my own life and my own happiness."</p>

								<p>"Overwhelmed by the circumstances in my life, I began calling SAHAI and speaking to the counsellors at the other end of the line. Suffering from depression for the past seven years, my wife’s mental and emotional state is such that she is not able to give our three children the love and attention that they deserve. Counselling is an option that she refuses to consider since she believes that only people who are “mad” go to a counsellor and she fears societal judgement if she seeks help. I am trying my best to play the role of both mother and father to my children but I am increasingly stretched thin. Though I know that the counsellors cannot fix my situation, speaking about it to them has helped me immensely. It has given me the strength to do everything in my power to give my children a happy life. Thank you for the valuable support."</p>
